- Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop.

- Responsive generally means to react quickly and positively to any change, while adaptive means to be easily modified for a new purpose or situation, such as change.

- Mobile, on the other hand, generally means to build a separate website commonly on a new domain solely for mobile users. 

- Flexible grids are built using relative length units, most commonly percentages or em units. These relative lengths are then used to declare common grid property values such as width, margin, or padding.

- Taking the flexible layout concept, and formula, and reapplying it to all parts of a grid will create a completely dynamic website, scaling to every viewport size. For even more control within a flexible layout, you can also leverage the min-width, max-width, min-height, and max-height properties.

-Media queries were built as an extension to media types commonly found when targeting and including styles. Media queries provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances, the width of the viewport or device orientation for example.

- Logical operators in media queries help build powerful expressions. There are three different logical operators available for use within media queries, including and, not, and only. Using the and logical operator within a media query allows an extra condition to be added, making sure that a browser or devices does both a, b, c, and so forth. Multiple individual media queries can be comma separated, acting as an unspoken or operator.

-Mobile First: The mobile first (Links to an external site.) approach includes using styles targeted at smaller viewports as the default styles for a website, then use media queries to add styles as the viewport grows.

-Using the viewport meta tag with either the height or width values will define the height or width of the viewport respectively. Each value accepts either a positive integer or keyword. For the height property the keyword device-height value is accepted, and for the width property the keyword device-width is accepted. Using these keywords will inherit the deviceâ€™s default height and width value.
