<h2>Reading JQuery Book: pg 293 -301</h2>
  <h2>6 Reasons for Paired Programming</h2>

Key Points:
1. jQuery is a javascript file that offers a simple way to run JavaScript tasks quickly and consistently across all major browsers without fallback code needed.
- select elements: $('li.hot') pg 296
- perform tasks: $('li.hot').addClass('complete'); pg 297
- handle events: 

2. JQuery example on pg 298, need to add link to jquery in the html file before closing the body element

3. Benefits of using JQuery on pg 300
- simple selectors
- common tasks in less code
- cross browser compatibility

4. Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to othersâ€™ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.

5. Pair programming also increases efficiency, engaged collaboration, learning from fellow students, social skills, job interview readiness, and work environment readiness
