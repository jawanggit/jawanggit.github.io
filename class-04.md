<h1> Functions, Methods, and Objects (pg 86-99) in Javascript book </h2>

<ul>key points

<li> parameters are passed into a function and the response is called the return value</li>

<li> functions store the code required to perofrma specific task </li>

<li> calling a function example: sayHello(); (this would be after you define a function)</li>

<li> key difference btw parameters vs argument (pg 93) is that parameters are variables, while arguments are the numbers assigned to the variables </li>

<li> functions can store multiple vlaues (pg 95) which can be helpful for consolidating code so that you are not writing seperate functions that are using the same parameters</li>

<li> function declaration vs function expression: declaration creates a function while expression assigns a function to a variable (ex: var area = function(width, height)). when this happens, it becomes an anonymous function.

<li> Immediately invoked function expressions (IIFE) do not have names (pg 97) and executed once as the interpreter comes across them. IIFE is helpful as a wrapper to prevent variables with same name in other scripts from affecting variables in the (). This is the idea of scoping.

<li>local variables vs global variables - when declared inside a function they are local and global when declared outside the funciton.

</ul>
