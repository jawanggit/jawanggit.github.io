<h1> Functions, Methods, and Objects (pg 86-99) in Javascript book </h2>

<ul>key points

<li> parameters are passed into a function and the response is called the return value</li>

<li> functions store the code required to perofrma specific task </li>

<li> calling a function example: sayHello(); (this would be after you define a function)</li>

<li> key difference btw parameters vs argument (pg 93) is that parameters are variables, while arguments are the numbers assigned to the variables </li>

<li> functions can store multiple vlaues (pg 95) which can be helpful for consolidating code so that you are not writing seperate functions that are using the same parameters</li>

<li> function declaration vs function expression: declaration creates a function while expression assigns a function to a variable (ex: var area = function(width, height)). when this happens, it becomes an anonymous function.

<li> Immediately invoked function expressions (IIFE) do not have names (pg 97) and executed once as the interpreter comes across them. IIFE is helpful as a wrapper to prevent variables with same name in other scripts from affecting variables in the (). This is the idea of scoping.

<li>local variables vs global variables - when declared inside a function they are local and global when declared outside the funciton.

</ul>

<h1> Chapter 15 - Layout </h1>
<ul>
<li> pg 361. browsers display pages in a normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.<li>
  <ul>
    <li>examples on pg 365-370</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>clearing floats allows you to say that no element should touch another</li>
  </ul>
<li>Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.</li>
  <ul> 
    <li>the pros and cons of fixed width vs liquuid are discussed on pg 381-382 </li>
  </ul>
<li>Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide and indicate what the site is about witin the top 600 pixels</li>
  <ul>
    <li>example layout are on pg 388 and css frameworks for layout are on pg 391</li>
    <li>960.GS CSS framework uses a 12 column grid on pg 392 </li>
