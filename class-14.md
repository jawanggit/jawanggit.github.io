Notes on CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations

Transforms using CSS3
- You can do 2D or 3D images which can rotate/move using CSS
- Perspective: In order for three-dimensional transforms to work the elements need a perspective from which to transform. The perspective for each element can be thought of as a vanishing point, similar to that which can be seen in three-dimensional drawings.

Transitions & Animations using CSS3
- transitions require an element to have different states which must be styled differently
- 4 transition properties: transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, transition delay
 - animations build out visual interactions from one state to another 
- To set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition, use the @keyframes rule. The @keyframes rule includes the animation name, any animation breakpoints, and the properties intended to be animated.
- Animations also provide the ability to further customize an elementâ€™s behavior, including the ability to declare the number of times an animation runs, as well as the direction in which an animation completes.
