  If you are building a site from scratch, it is good practice to create a folder for all of the images the site uses.  

  To add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes: src 

Height and width of images is controlled by height and width attributes that are defined in <img>: width ="xxx" and height = "xxx"
</p>
 <ol> 
  Where an image is placed in the code will affect how it is displayed. Here are three examples of image placement that produce different results:
 <li> before a paragraph The paragraph starts on a new line after the image.</li>
 <li> inside the start of a paragraph The first row of text aligns with the bottom of the image.</li>
 <li> in the middle of a paragraph The image is placed between the words of the paragraph that it appears in </li>
</ol>

<p>The align attribute was commonly used to indicate how the other parts of a page should flow around an image. It has been removed from HTML5 and new websites should use CSS to control the alignment of images (as you will see on pages 411-412).</p>

<p>jpeg vs gif: gif or png format is best when saving images with few colors or large areas of the same color.

Vector images are created by placing points on a grid, and drawing lines between those points. A color can then be added to "fill in" the lines that have been created. The advantage of creating line drawings in vector format is that you can increase the dimensions of the image without affecting the quality of it. 

Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.</p>
